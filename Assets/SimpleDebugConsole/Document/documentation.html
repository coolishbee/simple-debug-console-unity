<p>It is difficult to retrieve logs and warnings from Unity outside the
editor. To make it easier, this console displays output from
<code>Debug</code> in the game itself. This is especially useful on
mobile devices.</p>

<h2 id="installing">Installing</h2>
<h3 id="copy-script">Copy Script</h3>
<p>The <code>Console</code> component is entirely self-contained in
<em>Console.cs</em>, so installation is as simple as dragging this
script into your project.</p>

<p>Alternatively, add the package to your project via <a
href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html">UPM</a> using the Git
URL https://github.com/mminer/consolation.git. You can also clone the
repository and point UPM to your local copy.</p>

<h2 id="using">Using</h2>
<p>Attach the <code>Console</code> component to a game object. When
playing your game, open the console window with the back quote key
<kbd>`</kbd>. This shortcut is configurable in the inspector.</p>
<p>Alternatively, enable shake-to-open in the inspector to open the
console on mobile devices. The component provides an option to prevent
accidental shakes by requiring 3 or more fingers on the screen.</p>
<p>Several other settings like font size and the maximum log count are
also configurable in the inspector.</p>

platforms that Unity supports but it probably works on most.</p>
